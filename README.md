## Simple Unit Conversion Project

This project is a web-based unit conversion tool that allows users to convert between commonly used measurement units. It is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and provides a simple, interactive interface for three types of conversions: 

1. **Temperature Conversion**  
   - Converts **Celsius** to **Fahrenheit** using the formula:  
     \[
     (C*(9/5)) + 32
     \]

2. **Weight Conversion**  
   - Converts **Kilograms** to **Pounds** using the formula:  
     \[
     kg*2.205
     \]

3. **Distance Conversion**  
   - Converts **Kilometers** to **Miles** using the formula:  
     \[
     km*0.62137
     \]

### **Project Structure**
- **HTML (`m3_unitconversion.html`)**  
  - Contains the structure of the webpage.
  - Includes sections for each conversion type.
  - Provides input fields and buttons for user interaction.

- **CSS (`style.css`)**  
  - Styles the webpage with a clean, modern look.
  - Uses different colors for each conversion section.
  - Includes hover effects for buttons and navigation.

- **JavaScript (`scripts.js`)**  
  - Implements the conversion logic.
  - Retrieves user input, performs calculations, and updates the output fields dynamically.

### **Features**
âœ” Simple and intuitive UI  
âœ” Three different conversion calculators in one place  
âœ” Responsive design for better user experience  
âœ” Interactive buttons and hover effects  
âœ” Quick and accurate results  

This project is a great example of a beginner-friendly **web application** that utilizes fundamental **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** concepts. It can be expanded by adding more unit conversions or improving the UI for a better user experience. ðŸš€
